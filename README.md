# Prototype's Demo in Firebase Studio

This is a `NextJS` starter in **Firebase Studio** to demonstrate how to prototype applications in Firebase Studio and eventually host them on an external service like **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**.

The plans that were followed were:
1. Prototyping via a prompt suggested in Firebase Studio directly, the one for "Fridge Feast"
2. Debugging system (in the prototyping section, in the Firebase Studio IDE, etc.)
3. Then, how to connect this project to GitHub
4. How to deploy it to Vercel via GitHub
5. A final point was to ensure that the AI key works once deployed, as this is the major concern.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
